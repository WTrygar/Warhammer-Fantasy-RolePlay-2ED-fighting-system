# Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2nd Edition Battle Tracker

WFRP 2ED has a lot of data to follow for game masters, especially during combat.
That's why I'm making an app that keeps track of the battle for the game master.

## What can it do?

Right now code can handle group battles that ends when all of the heroes or all of the enemies are dead.
Characters can either attack anyone, or do nothing (more actions will be added in the future).

## List of ideas for future updates

Features that will be added in the future:
- Menu with options:
  - battle,
  - create/update character,
  - rearrange the teams,
- casting spells -> create a spell class,
- using items -> create an item class,
- more actions -> create functions in Character class,
- characters that value of attribute "attacks" is atleast 2, should be able to perform multiple attacks. If "attacks" is set to 1, it should be forbidden. 
- create more characters and weapons.

## Project setup

To run this app, download the code and install inquirer:

```
pip install inquirer
```

after that, open main.py and run it, battle will start!
