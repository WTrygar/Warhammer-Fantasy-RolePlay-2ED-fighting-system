Warhammer Fantasy RolePlay 2 edition has a lot of data to follow for game masters, especially during combat.
That's why I'm making a code that keeps track of the battle for the game master.

I'm using Object Oriented Programming paradigm, so that different classes could inherit methods from their parents.
Ex. Parent Class Character and it's children - PlayerCharacter and EnemyCharacter.

Right now code can handle group battles that ends when all of the heroes or all of the enemies are dead.
Characters can either attack anyone, or do nothing (more actions will be added in the future)
